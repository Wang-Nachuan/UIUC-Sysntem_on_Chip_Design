When the DMA Engine is running (DMACR.RS=1), CURDESC_PTR registers are updated by AXI DMA to indicate the current descriptor being worked on.
On error detection, CURDESC_PTR is updated to reflect the descriptor associated with the detected error.
Note: The register can only be written to by the CPU when the DMA Engine is Halted (DMACR.RS=0 and DMASR.Halted =1). At all other times, this register is Read Only (RO). Descriptors must be 16 word aligned, that is, 0x00, 0x40, 0x80 and others. Any other alignment has undefined results.

Otherwise, undefined results occur. When DMACR.RS is 1, CURDESC_PTR becomes Read Only (RO) and is used to fetch the first descriptor.
When the DMA Engine is running (DMACR.RS=1), CURDESC_PTR registers are updated by AXI DMA to indicate the current descriptor being worked on.
On error detection, CURDESC_PTR is updated to reflect the descriptor associated with the detected error.
Note: The register can only be written to by the CPU when the DMA Engine is Halted (DMACR.RS=0 and DMASR.Halted =1). At all other times, this register is Read Only (RO). Descriptors must be 16 word aligned, that is, 0x00, 0x40, 0x80 and others. Any other alignment has undefined results.
